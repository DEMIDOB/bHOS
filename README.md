# bHOS

(yet another one) open-source OS made by a dilettante who's just curious how things work

It's in a very-very early stage of development. Now, it's real-mode one-thread only, but there is something like a bootloader and a kernel, soooo.....


## Shell Commands

- `info`
- `proglist` will show you available programs (btw, you can write your own and include this in bHOS.asm, just mind the 32-byte signature - look at e.g. bHClock)
- `time`
- `kernel <args>` will make a kernel call and display the returned value  
`kernel run <number>` is a specific kernel call to run a program (*number* is the program's id given by the `proglist` command)


## Build&Run (Windows) [if you are interested in that]

- download FASM and unarchive it into the repository root directory, such that the **FASM** directory is next to **build.bat** (https://flatassembler.net/download.php)
- make sure you have UltraISO installed if you aim to run bHOS using any virtualization software
- `git clone`
- `build` - then you get a binary bHOS.bin which contains all you need
- UltraISO should have opened. Great. To the next step (go to what your goal is according to the title)


### Run using VirtualBox or other virtual machine

- UltraISO should have opened - you are ready to go
- go to *Bootable -> Load Boot File...* and select your bHOS.bin that has previously been generated by running the build command
- save the resulting *.iso* file wherever you want
- enjoy running this on your favorite virualization software


### Run on a real device

WARNING: that's your and only your responsibility! Do this on your own risk. Yep, it worked for me, but I can not guarantee you that everything will be fine in you case.

Works on intel-based processors - Intel Atom 100% :)

- download and install HxD (https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20)
- take a flash drive you definitely do not need (or not afraid of formatting)
- fomat it (NTFS, 512)
- open HxD **as administrator**
- select your flash drive (don't forget to uncheck *readonly*)
- open your bHOS.bin as well
- go to bHOS.bin tab
- `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`
- go to you flash drive tab
- `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+S`
- *yes* :)
- there you go, plug this flash drive in and enjoy!
