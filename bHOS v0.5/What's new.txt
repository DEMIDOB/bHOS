bHOS version 0.5 has been released!

What's new:
- completely rewritten kernel with FASM
- now with the own-made bootloader!
- time function added
- the development of bHSDK has begun!

Particulary about bootloader:
It is being located at the first sector of the flash drive and loads the system (which is located from the 2nd one)
to the RAM and jmps there. Boom!
